# NLP and Politics


**We're using natural language processing to give insights about political debates, broadcasts and tweets.**

```
git clone https://github.com/mlcuva/nlp-politics.git
```

One of our ideas is to label/track topics during debates.

Updates:
- Using TextBlob and Debate transcripts! (10/24/2019)
